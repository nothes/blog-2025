So, There's a thing happening this month, ala inktober, or mermay, called Blaugust. I lost the link, because I'm me (it's probably downstairs on my work computer, but that machine is Not Touched After Hours, it's the one rule I have for working from home). I digress, the point is, it's a "do a thing consistently, for a month" challenge.

If you know me, you may be aware that I have a tendency to be both competitive and stubborn, especially with myself. Soooooo, the moment I saw it, I was like, "ah, yes, of course I shall do this!" Will I finish out a whole month of daily posts? Who knows! Will 90% of them be about whichever plant in the house has a new leaf? Absolutely! Will there be comical photos of my fails at gardening and life? I promise there will be. Will there be fury venting about politics? It's possible, but hopefully not. Depends on how the primaries go, I suppose. 

So, if you're into that sort of thing, watch this space, 'cuz there's a whole lot of it in the works. I may have been saving updates on my various projects so I had something to share! Feel free to join in, even if you post once every other day, or every week, or whatever! There's no blog police!! \<sirens begin in the distance> Uh... I think. :P

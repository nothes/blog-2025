...aka, it's Plant Chore Sunday! ...Kind of. Really it's "go plant-shopping to fill in some holes in my aquarium, and while I'm out, stop by the hardware store for some weed-killer and a rescue orchid, and oh, those african violets need some attention" day. But that's a lot to say, so Plant Chore Sunday it is.

So first of all, my aquarium is just getting over an intense war with algae. (No, I'm not looking for advice, right now, I got this.) Poor Bloo (yes, Blooregard Q. Kazoo) was living in some seriously Mountain Dew-esque water for a bit there. I've raised the light, cut it back to 6 hours, and cut it down to 60% power, and after a 3-day black out, we're back to water that is actually transparent, mostly. Whew.

<figcaption>I swapped to a "better" light, and let it use it's default schedule, and this was the result. Oops!</figcaption>

However, the plants IN said tank have been... having feelings, and making them known. The anubius nana is perfectly happy - in fact, today I noticed that it's two plants whose rhysomes had been squashed together, so a gentle tug and I had twice as many plants! The cryptocoryne wendii green, though, decided that a couple days of no-light was justification for a full on tantrum, and melted most of it's leaves away. (That's what aquarium plants do when they get grumpy, they don't crisp up, they literally melt. It's kind of horrifying.) I also got, and then hated, some pogostemon stellatus 'Octopus', and yanked it out, so, the tank was looking kind of bare, as you can see. The roots of the scindapsus (which is _not_ pothos, nor philodendron, don't get me started!) helped, but more was needed. So, into the car, and off to Edmonds and Aquarium Co-op, which is always a fun trip!

I came home with another anubius, a java fern, and an optimistic replacement crypt, as well as some superglue. Which is how that one anubius ended up sideways, because apparently you shouldn't leave me unsupervised with glue and plants. Who knew! (My husband, he probably knew, but he didn't catch me, so I win!)

On the way home from Edmonds, I stopped in for a refill for my death-bottle of round-up, for the inevitable Round Two of my war of the bindweed, and saw they were selling these absolutely _tiny_ little [Better-Gro](https://www.better-gro.com/packaged_orchids.html) branded vanda and cattleya orchids. They were all in these little mesh sleeves, none of them seemed like they'd been watered in quite awhile, and I was extremely dubious. But, I stopped to take a look, and found a cattleya with a new growth starting, and decided to take a chance. Time will tell, but as far as timing goes, it's the right point in the growth cycle to attempt a rescue!

<figcaption>The entire plant's fate is resting on your hands, tiny new growth, no pressure! (To give you a sense of scale, that's a 2" diameter saucer she's sitting on.)</figcaption>

<figcaption>This is the only healthy root in the entire pot. I left one mostly-dead one on for support and in case it wasn't completely done for, but I don't have high hopes.</figcaption>
</figure>

I cruised the clearance racks while I was there, and wow, there was nothing with any life worth rescuing there, the whole way across, and plenty of plants on the full-price shelves that deserved to be on the clearance rack. Kind of embarrassing, really. Water your plants, Lowes!

So, back home I went, got my aquarium sorted, and the cattleya assessed, and was about to clean up for the day, when I looked over at my window sill, and realized I had not one, but two african violets that were more sucker than mother-plant. "I may as well, I'm already making a mess," I thought, and grabbed em down to figure out what was going on in that wild chaos of leaves.

Closest to us, we have a small fuzzy-leafed plant growing in a circular pattern with round leaves on long stems, in every direction. it's in a 3 inch pot, and the leaves stretch beyond it's edges. Behind it are four other smaller versions of the same plant in a row, each in a two-inch pot. A small pile of broken leaves sits in a corner of the tray.">
<figcaption>Momma, you had four babies! how did all of that fit in the same pot?</figcaption>
<img src="{{imageDir}}plants/afVio.jpg" alt="a lone african violet plant sits on the baking tray. It's leaves, instead of going outwards radially, seem to be going in multiple directions.">
<figcaption>I didn't get a photo of pre-delivery momma the first, but here's the second one, before she was separated.</figcaption>

<figcaption>This was one of two babies I removed from her, it rivals it's parent in size!</figcaption>
<img src="{{imageDir}}plants/babies.jpg" alt="A tray with six new plants all in their little pots.">

</figure>

What was going on was _six_ baby suckers on two plants, one was almost as big as the mother plant! When I pulled em off, all but one had their own root systems starting, so I potted them up, and started texting my neighbors to see if anyone wanted a free fuzzy plants. One taker, so far! I've got 4 left, so if you're local and want a baby violet, and can be bothered to come snag it, well, you know how to find me!

Putting the babies away under my grow lights led me to eye my other baby orchids, so check out how great this Sharry Baby seedling is doing! Some year soon, my whole office is gonna smell like chocolate!

Happy Sunday, hope y'all were as productive as I was!!

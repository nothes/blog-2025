I'm going to try (hahahahaha!) to keep posting regularly, but I don't have any other big exciting projects going, so instead, I'm going to tell you all about my delightfully quiet and peaceful weekend! 

Thursday was my short day, since Friday was a national holiday, so John & I went to REI for new shoes, and then Lowes for a new door handle, since the mechanism inside mine had worn and it was taking more and more force to get it to _open_ properly. Did you know that front door handles, without deadbolts cost $100?!? I did not!

Friday I went to war vs my infinite collection of dandelions. My current theory is, if i pull a bucket up each weekend, some day they won't keep coming back. So far, no good, though the sad anemic leaves they put up and get stuck under the mulch did bring me some joy. Could you please, just stop it, without my having to put a ton of effort into digging out every bit of tap-root you have?? No? Damn.

Saturday was a trip up to Capital Hill so John could pick out some new markers, we could get some brunch, and stop in to Elliot Bay Books. I'm armed with kid books for my older nephew's birthday, and a "consolation prize" for his little brother, because it can be hard to have to wait 6 whole months for your turn! I got myself a comic book about tarot, and a little Shakespeare-themed book nook kit, too. This meant Saturday afternoon found John & I sat around the dinner table, assembling, gluing, coloring, and watching youtube. I didn't even notice how late it got till my stomach rumbled & I realized that it was my turn to feed us!! The day wound down with a cat cuddle while watching a friend play the Still Wakes The Deep DLC, which felt rushed but was still quite interesting.

<figcaption>This went together impressively smoothly, and the kit had a ton of spare pieces, Just In Case. It even turns the light on when motion is detected!</figcaption>

Sunday was a trip to Swansons for a new toilet fern, some slug repellant, and lunch, while John went to the Sounders game, and then caught the USMNT game. I came home with a lemon button fern, which is apparently a miniature Boston fern! I had no idea! In case you, too, were wondering, a toilet fern is a fern that lives on the back tank of the toilet. it does not grow _in_ the toilet, in any way, and no the goal is that it's small enough not to tickle the user. It just makes the space a little more... green and happy! I had a blue star fern there, after the maidenhair outgrew the space, but Blaze decided that it's fronds had the _best_ mouthfeel, and kept eating them. Rude, tiny cat, rude! 

I also got an impatiens - did you know they're apparently full shade growers? So now one is on my back deck in the pot with the primroses that overwintered successfully, and a volunteer sword fern. We'll see how it does, but I have high hopes!

Which led to my eying the Inside Plants, and realizing I should've repot like three or four of my orchids this spring, but neglected to do so. Everyone is crawling right out of their pots! I blame this on fickle sympodial orchids deciding one direction of growth isn't good enough! Might be time to split the big dendrobium, before it eats the entire shelf. Also on the list is the oncidium on the top shelf, who is _also_ climbing out of her pot, and the tiny guy on the sink that may have outgrown it's tiny-pot, but if I up-pot it, I'll have to find it a new home, and it's growing so well where it is. I dunno what I wanna do there.

In short, I got a lot of good productive things done, spent a bunch of quality time with my husband, and enjoyed some time outside! We celebrated John's birthday, played some video games, cuddled with cats, and generally had a great time just relaxing. Depending on the weather, next week I might try'n bring out the air foil!

I grew up in the Central Valley in California. No, that's not "the Valley" that they talk about down in LA, it's the big dent running down the center of the stat that you can see _from space_. It's in the middle, thus "central". It's where a lot of the food you eat comes from. In the summers growing up it hit 104F a couple times a year. I played contact sports in weather in the mid-to-high 90's regularly. I had never seen snow till I moved up here.

Which is to say, Seattle has spoiled me. It was 90 today, and I hated it. There's no AC in my place, why would there be, we'd never use it, a window is usually quite sufficient to keep things cooled down. Until, you know, we decided to continue to ruin the planet, because changing our ways is inconvenient, and how bad could it really be, anyway? ...Bad. It could be bad. 

I am a huge pile of crabby frustration. So is Spark, he's been yelling at me off and on for hours. Blaze has moved in down in my office where it's cooler, and now lives in my bookshelf in a space only he can get into. God help anyone who has to communicate with me in the couple days. 

PS: As I type this, Blaze started singing the song of his people from under the bed, so apparently he got lonely and moved back up here. Poor baby. :P

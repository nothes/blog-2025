# About Me

Hi, I'm Rachael, or Rey, but never Rach. I'm short, and I bite, so don't try me on this one, I go for kneecaps! :P I'm 40-mumble, I've been working at the same tech company since I graduated college in 2005, so I've been a software developer for mac & iOS for 20 years, as of this writing. I probably won't talk too much about it, here, though. I try to leave work _at_ work, and bring the fun things home! 

I am a fiber artist (wow, I don't think I've ever called myself that, before!), I knit, spin, weave, crochet a bit, and always love to learn new techniques. I also sew, and do various forms of needlework with various levels of skill, including adjusting patterns to fit me properly, and quilting. 

I am a weird plant nerd, with a special appreciation for all plants _weird_. I have a tiny indoor bog full of carnivorous plants, and a stash of orchids, none of which are the ones you see at the grocery store because those mofos HATE me.

I love questions, and enabling people to do and explore things, and hate being condescended to, so if you're contemplating whether to ping me on mastodon or whatever, consider if it's a "please help me learn something new" (and send that mofo!), or a "you should just", in which case, just, you know, hit delete & save us both some sanity.

I'm a left-handed dyslexic who sometimes stutters, and cannot type things correctly to save her life, and firmly believes if your brain won't make all the right chemicals, store-bought is fine. So, in short, a mess! Mostly I embrace the chaos, these days, but it's been a struggle to get there & it probably will be, off and on, till I'm done with this life. Hopefully someone else reads that, and knows they're not alone, and there is hope. Things Will Get Better!

Welcome!
